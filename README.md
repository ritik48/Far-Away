### Far Away 

It's a simple application, where a user can input the items that he needs to take while going on a trip.

It provides the following features:
- user can mark the items as packed 
- items can be removed
- items can be seen in sorted order based on packed, input or description


With this application I got hands on experience with concepts like state management, lifting up state and many more in react.
